# Music-Recommender-System-SVD
This project implements a music recommender system using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict user listening preferences. It leverages collaborative filtering techniques to identify latent patterns in user-song interaction data, providing personalized song recommendations based on user listening history.
